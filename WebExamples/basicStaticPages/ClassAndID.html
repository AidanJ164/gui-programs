<p class="centerbox">Swipped from Wikipedia: Kumquats (Citrus japonica) 
are a group of small fruit-bearing trees in the flowering plant family 
Rutaceae. They were previously classified as forming the now historical genus 
Fortunella, or placed within Citrus sensu lato.<br>
The edible fruit closely resembles the orange (Citrus sinensis), 
but it is much smaller, being approximately the size and shape of a 
large olive. Kumquat is a fairly cold-hardy citrus.</p>

<h2>Name</h2>
<p>
The English name "kumquat" derives from the Cantonese gām-gwāt,
 literally meaning "golden orange" or "golden tangerine".
</p><p>
Though loquats are not botanically related to kumquats, the terms 
derive from the same Chinese word for "orange". Lou4gwat1, literally
 "black orange", originally referred to unripe kumquats, which are 
 dark green, but due to a misunderstanding by poet Su Shi, Cantonese
 regions widely took up the new name for the non-citrus fruit known 
 in Mandarin Chinese as a pipa.[citation needed]
Origin
</p><p>
The kumquat plant is native to south Asia and the Asia-Pacific region.
 The earliest historical reference to kumquats appears in literature 
 of China in the 12th century. They have long been cultivated in 
 India, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and southeast Asia. They 
 were introduced to Europe in 1846 by Robert Fortune, collector for the 
 London Horticultural Society, and shortly thereafter into North America.

They are slow-growing evergreen shrubs or short trees, from 2.5 to 
4.5 meters (8 to 15 ft) tall, with dense branches, sometimes bearing 
small thorns. The leaves are dark glossy green, and the flowers are 
white, similar to other citrus flowers, borne singly or clustered in 
the leaf-axils. Depending on size, the kumquat tree can produce 
hundreds or even thousands of fruits each year.

<h2 id="varietal">Varieties</h2>
<p>
When the kumquats are divided into multiple species, the name 
Fortunella japonica (or Citrus japonica) is retained by this group.
 The round kumquat also called Marumi kumquat or Morgani kumquat, 
 is an evergreen tree, producing edible golden-yellow fruit. The 
 round Hawaiian varietal, the "Meiwa kumquat", is eaten raw. 
 The fruit is small and usually round but can be oval shaped. 
 The peel has a sweet flavor but the fruit has a sour center. 
 The fruit can be eaten cooked but is mainly used to make marmalades 
 and jellies. It is grown as an ornamental plant and can be used in bonsai. 
 The plant symbolizes good luck in China and other Asian countries, 
 where it is kept as a houseplant and given as a gift during the 
 Lunar New Year. Round kumquats are more commonly cultivated than
 other species due to their cold tolerance.
